lakbay: A Mobile Application for Recommending Tourist Attractions via Hybrid Filtering  Approach

It is a mobile travel recommendation application using  the Flutter framework, the Dart language, and the Python language.
It utilizes recommendation algorithms such as the Item-based Collaborative Filtering and the Content-based Filtering.

This project was a group effort that was submitted on July 15, 2023 as a Final Project requirement during my 3rd year in College.

## About
This project aims to promote tourism and cultural awareness of the country by creating an application that can recommend its users possible tourist destinations and provide comprehensive information about that place, the recommendation algorithm will be the main focus of this project as it creates 3 different outputs based on the algorithm used, the first output which is based on the user’s preferences themselves, the other will be based on the other user’s ratings and preferences, and the last output would be a combination of the two in order to provide the user’s a diverse set of locations to choose from.

## Objectives
This study aims to develop a mobile application to recommend tourist spots, using a Hybrid Filtering algorithm, in the Philippines for visiting tourists. Specifically, the system aims to:
- Develop a mobile application that uses a Hybrid Filtering algorithm to recommend similar tourist attractions based on user preferences.
- Implement an algorithm that uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, enhancing the diversity of recommendations.
- Integrate the different information about tourist attractions, descriptions for the tourist attractions, ratings, comments, saved places, and other necessary details.
- Promote local tourism and cultural awareness by offering comprehensive information spanning from cultural and historical views to famous tourist destinations in the Philippines.

## Significance
The significance of this study aims to promote local tourism in the Philippines and create a mobile environment where tourists can experience certain tourist attractions. Lakbay lets tourists immerse themselves fully in the cultural wonders that the mobile application has provided them. The following people will benefit from the contents of this study:
- Tourists and tourism agencies- This is a great help for tourists for them to be guided correctly about each tourist spot and attraction in the Philippines that they would like to travel to, as well as to inform tourism agencies to use this application to promote local tourism in the Philippines.
- Local Government - This research will help the local government by providing features for promoting tourism in the Philippines. It plays an essential role in the country's tourism industry as it boosts the current tourism sector of the GDP in the Philippines.
- Future Researchers - This can be a research guide for future researchers in their study as a basis of information. They can use this study to promote local tourism in the Philippines and further improve their research.
